#About EcoTraQ

Challenge: Our Earth is finite

Motivation:
Our earth has been subject to unprecedented change since its conception. Following the industrial revelation we have strained the earth's resources and continue to do so. This cannot continue. We must act to take long strides in positively impacting our climate. This progress all starts from each individual to do their part.

Goal:
Our project had three goals:

> Develop programs to determine the impact of a user's carbon footprint in relation to the Canadian per capita average.

> Develop programs to determine the impact of a website's carbon footprint based on physical server hosted websites.

> Inform people how everyone contributes to global warming everyday, and even just browsing the internet negatively affects our world.

Approach:
We used HTML to create the basic outline of the site alongside the questionnaire to retrieve user data. We used CSS to add to the visual appeal of the UI. Finally, we also use JS to script the calculation of the carbon footprint. This is done by assigning variables to each option of each question in the questionnaire. The script then adds up the result and displays the information alongside the average per capita emissions in Canada following the submit form input.

Application:
Our programs accurately found the carbon emission of a given user's data based on recent Canada energy and census reports. For SiteTraQ, we were able to precisely determine the server emissions cost of any given website using advanced JS scripting on the backend side.

How?

Our design/programming and web-hosting processes

The first step was identifying the problem. After brainstorming we concluded that people live their everyday lives oblivious that every decision they make alters their impact on our environment. Through extensive research, we looked to find what Canadians could do to lower their carbon footprint.
The second step was identifying means of the solution. We decided to make EcoTraQ a web-application hosted on GitHub. We settled on 3 principal solutions, a questionnaire that once filled out provides the users carbon footprint, a function of comparing the results with the mean Canadian footprint, and a secondary product which determines the carbon footprint of any given website
We created our very first web application prototype with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in around 1-2 weeks. From here we polished up the code and further programmed the UI to our liking, and used GitHub's Repository tools to host a website server for EcoTraQ.
Following that, we drafted the content of our product. We wrote and researched on how people could lower their carbon footprint through accessing their daily and weekly habits to determine what they can do to reduce the impact of their carbon footprint.
In order to quantise results and have users be able to compare what they see to something tangible and more comprehensible, we chose to add the feature of displaying the average Canadian's carbon footprint.
Finally, we add the finishing touches to the applications functionality, such as having a language selector, where users can toggle French or English. This feature uses JavaScript to detect the users device language as they open the page.

Conclusions:

Increased Awareness: Participants likely became more aware of their personal carbon footprint and how their daily decisions contribute to it. This heightened awareness is crucial for creating a sense of responsibility and accountability towards environmental sustainability.


Technology for Good: The use of coding languages and web hosting platforms like GitHub highlights the role of technology in addressing environmental challenges. By using digital tools to create accessible and user-friendly solutions, the project exemplifies how technology can be harnessed for the greater good.


Quantifiable Impact: By using the Carbon Footprint Calculator (EcoTraQ), users could quantify their carbon footprint in terms of CO2 emissions. Seeing the numerical value of their impact may have made the issue more tangible and actionable.


Comparison and Benchmarking: By comparing their results with the average among Canadians, participants could contextualize their own carbon footprint with a larger lens and look at the bigger picture. This benchmarking could motivate individuals to strive for reductions and improvements.

Whatâ€™s Next?

Future:
Every year statistics change and averages fluctuate, meaning our final product must be maintained in order to obtain and release the most up-to-date product. We want people to live life having a positive impact on their habitat, this can only happen if we are aware of our impact on our environment.
Improvements:
Research more effective questions to ask in the questionnaire, in order to receive more accurate results
We could improve the user interface, so as to improve accessibility and ease of use.
We can provide further detailed insight on how participants can lower their footprint.
