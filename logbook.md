Project Conception and Initial Direction
Entry 1: Initial Idea and Research (April - November 2024)
Our project's journey began immediately following the previous year's science fair, with an ambitious concept to test military-grade materials against harsh natural climates, under the working title Metallica. This idea was conceived during a walk on the Carleton Campus on April 5th, 2024. Over the summer, we conducted extensive research to flesh out this concept, intending to incorporate virtual reality (VR) using Unity to simulate climatic conditions. We also aimed to design a novel compound that would outperform existing materials. In the fall, we reevaluated the feasibility of VR due to logistical constraints, as only one team member had access to the technology. By October and November, we had completed our research on chemical material compounds and weather patterns.
Challenges and Pivots
Entry 2: Realization of Project Impossibility and First Pivot (December 2024 - January 2025)
In December and January, we shifted our focus to developing the backend and frontend of our project, completing the website design and user experience. However, a critical review from one of our mentors revealed a significant obstacle: the data required for our research was either non-existent or inaccessible. This meant that realizing our initial project would necessitate years of extensive material research, which was beyond our scope. Consequently, we were forced to pivot. We explored an agriculture-based project focusing on how carbon emissions affect crop growth, yield, and harvest seasons. However, we quickly discovered that the necessary APIs were also inaccessible, leading to another change in direction.
Entry 3: Second Pivot and Refinement of EcoTraQ (February 2025 - Present)
Faced with these challenges, we decided to return to and refine EcoTraQ, our carbon footprint tracking tool from the previous year. We recognized that EcoTraQ was a viable project with proven functionality, and we aimed to perfect it. We began by analyzing the feedback received from judges in the previous year to identify areas for improvement. Our refinements included:
Enhancing visual representation with more charts and graphs.
Improving project display and information relevance.
Providing more detailed and actionable feedback to users.
Refining the questionnaire sections for better data collection.
Expanding the information provided in SiteTraQ.
This pivot allowed us to focus on a project with proven feasibility and potential for significant impact.
Project Overview and Inspiration
Entry 1: Project Conception and Motivation
The project was conceived with the purpose of creating digital tools that would raise awareness about carbon footprints and promote sustainable living among individuals and businesses. Our motivation stemmed from the observation that many people are unaware of the significant environmental impact of their daily choices, including the carbon emissions generated by internet usage. We aimed to address this lack of awareness by developing accessible tools that quantify this impact and encourage positive behavioral changes. The primary problem we sought to solve was the overuse of Earth's resources, which necessitates increased awareness and action regarding personal and digital carbon footprints.
Our goals were threefold:
Develop EcoTraQ, a personal carbon footprint calculator.
Develop SiteTraQ, a website carbon footprint analyzer.
Educate people about the environmental impact of daily actions and website browsing.
Ultimately, these tools were designed to empower individuals and businesses to make informed, eco-friendly choices that contribute to a more sustainable future.
Development Process and Methodology
Entry 2: Development Approach and Tools
Our development approach involved utilizing HTML for the basic structure of the web applications, CSS for visual styling and user interface design, and JavaScript for implementing the core functionality, including the calculation of carbon footprints. For EcoTraQ, we developed a questionnaire-based system, where user responses were assigned carbon footprint values and compared to Canadian averages to provide context. SiteTraQ, on the other hand, employed a JavaScript API to analyze website data, such as traffic and page views, to estimate carbon emissions.
Our design process began with:
Identifying the problem of environmental unawareness.
Conceptualizing EcoTraQ and SiteTraQ as web applications hosted on GitHub.
Creating initial prototypes using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Refining the code and user interface based on testing and feedback.
Implementing features like language selection to enhance accessibility and average footprint comparisons to provide users with a benchmark.
Our research involved collecting carbon footprint values from Canadian Census data and other reliable sources to ensure the accuracy of our calculations.
Entry 3: Implementation and Technical Details
The backend of EcoTraQ was implemented using JavaScript to assign specific carbon footprint values to each questionnaire option, organize these values into relevant categories, and calculate the user's total carbon footprint. We also developed a feedback mechanism that provides users with tailored advice based on their results. For SiteTraQ, we utilized a web scraping API to retrieve website traffic and page view data, which was then processed to estimate the website's carbon emissions. The applications underwent rigorous testing to ensure accurate calculations and a user-friendly interface.
We encountered challenges in:
Ensuring accurate data retrieval and calculations.
Creating an intuitive user interface.
Implementing a seamless language selection feature.
These challenges were addressed through careful debugging and iterative improvements.
SiteTraQ: API Integration and Data Extraction Log
Date of Entry: SiteTraQ Development - API and Data Handling Challenges
This entry documents the challenges encountered during the development of SiteTraQ, specifically focusing on the integration of the website intelligence API and the handling of the returned data. The primary goal was to retrieve and display relevant website information, including carbon emissions estimates, using data provided by the API.
Challenges and Resolutions:
Incorrect API Endpoint: Initially, the code was making requests to an incorrect API endpoint (/lookup-all instead of /lookup). This resulted in the API returning data in an unexpected format, leading to errors in data extraction. Resolution: After carefully reviewing the API documentation, the correct endpoint (/lookup) was identified and implemented. The function responsible for fetching data was renamed from fetchAllWebsiteData to fetchLookupData to reflect this change. Impact: This significantly improved the code's ability to retrieve data, aligning it with the API's intended usage.
Incorrect Data Path: The code used an incorrect path to access the website traffic data within the API's JSON response. The path included an extraneous cb object, which was not present in the /lookup endpoint's response structure. Resolution: The data path was corrected by removing the erroneous cb object. The correct path (allWebsiteData.data.info.semrush_summary.semrush_visits_latest_month) was implemented, ensuring that the code accessed the data at the correct location within the JSON structure. Impact: This resolved the issue of consistently receiving "Website data not available" messages, enabling the code to extract the website traffic data when available.
Handling Missing Data: It was observed that the API did not always return data for all requested fields, particularly the website traffic data (semrush_visits_latest_month). This led to errors when the code attempted to access non-existent properties. Resolution: The code was modified to include checks for the existence of nested properties using the optional chaining operator (?.). This prevented errors and allowed the code to gracefully handle cases where data was missing, displaying "N/A" or appropriate messages to the user. Impact: This improved the robustness of the application, making it more resilient to variations in the API's responses.
HTTP 503 Errors: Intermittent HTTP 503 errors ("Service Unavailable") were encountered, indicating temporary server-side issues with the API. Resolution: A retry mechanism was implemented in the JavaScript code. The code now automatically retries API requests up to 3 times when a 503 error is received, with increasing delays between retries. This helps to overcome transient API unavailability. Impact: This significantly reduced the frequency of errors experienced by the user, improving the reliability of the application.
Asynchronous Operations and Error Handling: Managing asynchronous operations (API calls) and handling potential errors required careful use of try...catch...finally blocks and promises. Ensuring that errors were caught and handled gracefully was crucial for a stable application. Resolution: The code was structured to use async/await for asynchronous operations, and try...catch...finally blocks were used to handle potential errors. Specific error messages were displayed to the user to provide feedback on API failures or other issues. Impact: This resulted in more robust error handling and improved user feedback, enhancing the overall user experience.
